## [Unreleased]

## [0.5.2] - 2026-05-06

### Changed
- Base image shrunk from ~4.0GB to ~1.9GB (-52%) via three Dockerfile
  tweaks: `rustup` now installs with `--profile minimal` (drops rust-docs);
  `just` is fetched via `cargo binstall` instead of compiled from source;
  and the `chmod -R a+rwX` previously applied in the `useradd` layer was
  removed — that layer was creating a copy-on-write duplicate of every
  file under `/usr/local/rustup` and `/usr/local/cargo` (~500MB). Cargo
  perms are still set in the prior `just`-install RUN. Rebuilt project
  images shrink proportionally (e.g. `plotzy` 9.8GB → 5.0GB).

## [0.5.1] - 2026-05-05

### Added
- `cargo-binstall` is now installed in the base image and used to fetch
  prebuilt binaries for `ward`, `exp`, and `sumo` instead of cloning each
  repo and running `cargo build --release`. This skips ~3 release builds
  per fresh image — the Rust toolchain is no longer on the hot path for
  these tools. Pinned versions: `bcl-ward@0.1.2` (base image),
  `exp@0.1.2`, `bcl-sumo@0.1.4` (stacked layers). Versions are
  `--build-arg`-overridable via `WARD_VERSION` / `EXP_VERSION` /
  `SUMO_VERSION`. Resolution depends on each crate's
  `[package.metadata.binstall]` block, so URL/binary naming is owned by
  the upstream repo, not claudine.

## [0.5.0] - 2026-05-05

### Added
- `sumo` layer: Sumo Logic log query CLI, built from
  [Battle-Creek-LLC/sumo](https://github.com/Battle-Creek-LLC/sumo).

### Changed
- Compiled-from-source layers (`lin`, `exp`, `sumo`, `glab`, `rodney`) now
  clean up their build caches at the end of each `RUN`. Rust layers remove
  `/usr/local/cargo/{registry,git}`; Go layers remove `/root/go` and
  `/root/.cache/go-build`. This shrinks per-project images by hundreds of
  megabytes per compiled tool.

## [0.4.1] - 2026-05-04

### Added
- `groff` in the base image so CLI tools that render man pages on demand
  (notably AWS CLI v2's `aws help`) work without errors.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-05-02

### Added
- `pnpm` is now pre-installed (via `corepack prepare pnpm@latest --activate`)
  in the `node-20`, `node-22`, and `node-24` layers, so the binary is baked
  into the image instead of downloaded on first use.
- `SECURITY.md` documenting the project's vulnerability reporting policy.
- GitHub Actions `dependency-review` workflow that flags risky dependency
  changes on pull requests.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-04-28

### Added
- `libdbus-1-dev` in the base image so projects linking dbus-rs / zbus build
  out of the box.

## [0.2.1] - 2026-04-27

### Fixed
- Home volume now mounts at `/home/claude` (the passwd entry) instead of
  `/project/home`. OpenSSH resolves `~/.ssh` via `getpwuid()`, not `$HOME`,
  so mounting at the passwd home ensures SSH keys, known_hosts, and `$HOME`
  all point to the same location without any env-var override.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-04-25

### Changed
- Bind-mount + home-volume is now the only supported project layout. `host_dir`
  defaults to `~/projects/<name>/` when not set in config, eliminating the need
  to ever explicitly configure it for new projects.
- Container working directory and volume mounts now use the host path verbatim
  (e.g. `/Users/you/projects/myproject`) rather than the fixed `/project` alias.

### Removed
- `migrate` command — all projects now use the bind-mount layout; the migration
  path is no longer needed.
- Legacy single-volume layout support (`claudine_<project>` Docker volume, `~/share/<project>/`
  fallback, and all associated code paths).

## [0.1.2] - 2026-04-21

### Fixed
- Corrected v0.1.1 tag (was force-updated after initial release; this is the
  clean re-release of the same fix with proper version history)

## [0.1.1] - 2026-04-21

### Fixed
- `repo add` SSH host key verification failure — OpenSSH resolves `~/.ssh` via
  `getpwuid()` (the passwd home `/home/claude`), not `$HOME`, so the key and
  config in `/project/home/.ssh/` were never found. Clone containers now set
  `GIT_SSH_COMMAND` with explicit `-i`, `UserKnownHostsFile`, and
  `StrictHostKeyChecking=accept-new` pointing at `/project/home/.ssh/`.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-04-20

### Added
- Core `init`, `run`, `shell`, `destroy`, `purge`, `build` commands
- `repo add / remove / list` subcommands for managing repositories in a project
- `layer` system with catalog: node-20, node-24, rust, go, python-venv, postgres,
  msodbc, flyway, heroku, gh, glab, lin, exp, terra, rodney
- Per-layer post-build smoke-test validation (`claudine build --validate`)
- `zed` command for Zed dev container integration with per-repo workspace targeting
- Agent-assisted `init` via `claudine init --agent <path>` (Claude analyzes a
  local folder and proposes repos + layers)
- SSH key detection from `~/.ssh/config` with host alias resolution
- Bind-mount + home-volume project layout (host dir + named volume for `$HOME`)
- `migrate` command to move legacy single-volume projects to the new layout
- Shell completion generation (`claudine completions`)
- Passthrough arguments in `claudine shell`
- `terra` layer built from host-side source checkout with guild CLI and default config seeding
- `just` command runner pre-installed in the base image
- Persistent containers across sessions; `destroy` vs `purge` distinction
