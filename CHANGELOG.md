## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.1] - 2026-04-21

### Fixed
- `repo add` SSH host key verification failure — `gosu` was resetting `HOME` to
  `/home/claude` (the passwd entry) after the container was started with
  `-e HOME=/project/home`, causing SSH to look for keys and config in the wrong
  directory. The entrypoint now preserves the caller-provided `HOME` via
  `env HOME=` after the privilege drop.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-04-20

### Added
- Core `init`, `run`, `shell`, `destroy`, `purge`, `build` commands
- `repo add / remove / list` subcommands for managing repositories in a project
- `layer` system with catalog: node-20, node-24, rust, go, python-venv, postgres,
  msodbc, flyway, heroku, gh, glab, lin, exp, terra, rodney
- Per-layer post-build smoke-test validation (`claudine build --validate`)
- `zed` command for Zed dev container integration with per-repo workspace targeting
- Agent-assisted `init` via `claudine init --agent <path>` (Claude analyzes a
  local folder and proposes repos + layers)
- SSH key detection from `~/.ssh/config` with host alias resolution
- Bind-mount + home-volume project layout (host dir + named volume for `$HOME`)
- `migrate` command to move legacy single-volume projects to the new layout
- Shell completion generation (`claudine completions`)
- Passthrough arguments in `claudine shell`
- `terra` layer built from host-side source checkout with guild CLI and default config seeding
- `just` command runner pre-installed in the base image
- Persistent containers across sessions; `destroy` vs `purge` distinction
